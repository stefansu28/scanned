#+TITLE: Scanned Synthesis

* Tasks

** TODO move scanned synthesis to its own file
This will probably require a makefile

** TODO update scanned system
**** DONE include the updateRate and updateSize/updateStep
**** TODO dampening per point mass

** TODO allow for more customizeable scanners
maybe just do "adjacency" matrix or allow custom functions which take the state positions and the frequency as parameters

** TODO note data structure
This should allow for easier composition
should include the note to play, for how long, and the amplitude/velocity
could even have scanned system parameters

** TODO music utils file
put things like converting notes to frequencies
and scales and maybe the sample rate into its own file
